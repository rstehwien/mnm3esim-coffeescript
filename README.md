Get going quickly on your next project.

**Getting Started**

1. Install Node.js: `http:\\nodejs.org`
1. Install dependencies `npm install -g` or `npm install -g --dev` if you are going to do development.  Check 'package.json' for the dependencies that will be installed
1. Make sure you set NODE_PATH
1. Run `cake` to see what compile, run, and test options you have

May want to install the packages by hand as the above steps can fail for some reason
`npm install -g coffee-script underscore async mocha chai colors uglify-js nodewatch which docco`
